>Winning doesn't mean anything unless someone else loses â€” The Man in Black, Westworld

But the motivational effects of competition aren't that simple. Murayama and Elliot's (2012) set of meta-analyses found competition had positive *and* negative effects on participant performance. The effects of competition were a function of participant performance goals. Did participants want to win or did they want to avoid losing? Murayama and Elliot found that participants who wanted to avoid performing worse than others... performed worse in competition. And participants who wanted to perform better than others... benefitted from competition. Competition motivates people who want to win and demotivates everyone else.




By default, people choose to compare upwards.

When comparing upwards, they self-evaluate down. When comparing downwards, they self-evaluate up. This effect is stronger when comparing themselves on ability or affect.

Dissimilarity priming was associated with contrast. Similarity priming had weak assimilation effects.

Assimilation doesn't appear to be the default; it requires special priming.

Thinking they can win requires special priming.



Competition induces social comparison. This is dangerous because trying to avoid losing reduces goal achievement (Burnette et al 2013) and performance (Murayama & Elliot 2012).

Progress monitoring increase goal achievement, especially when outcomes are reported or made public, and when info is physically recorded (Harkin et al 2016)
