# WORKING TITLE (How to Motivate With Leaderboards: Stop Creating Losers)

Opener

- Leaderboards - what they are and where you’ve seen them
- How leaderboards are typically used

A Motivation Problem

Competition isn’t motivating. Satisfaction of competence/mastery is.

Leaderboards create losers.

Fixing Leaderboards

- provide feedback
- Group vs individual goals
- Every person is valued by the group; not just the winners
- The point isn’t winning; its to play the game well with others
- People will game the system if you focus too much on point
- The leaderboard is the DV and incidental... not the point of playing or the driver
