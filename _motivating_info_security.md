# How to Increase Adoption of Password Managers: Stop Scaring and Start Motivating

# [Opener]

>On March 19 of this year, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta received an alarming email that appeared to come from Google.

>The email, however, didn't come from the internet giant. It was actually an attempt to hack into his personal account. In fact, the message came from a group of hackers that security researchers, as well as the US government, believe are spies working for the Russian government. At the time, however, Podesta didn't know any of this, and he clicked on the malicious link contained in the email, giving hackers access to his account.

There is a zeitgeist shift in the air. Massive phishing scams, data breaches, and identify theft are in the news. People are understandably worried. It's not just government employees who are vulnerable, but all of us. In 2015, there were 2 billion Internet users, and cybercrime cost the world $3 *trillion*. By 2021, there will be 6 billion Internet users, and the cost of cybercrime is [expected to rise to $6 *trillion*](https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/) per year. Everything on Planet Earth — people, places, and things — are rapidly connected to the Internet. Much faster than our ability to secure them. For example, at this moment, there are 1.4 billion stolen passwords freely [available online](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3266607/password-security/1-4b-stolen-passwords-are-free-for-the-taking-what-we-know-now.html).

#### [Showing this is a behavioral problem]

If the Internet is like an "information superhighway", then most of us are driving around in a car without airbags or seat belts. People often engage in poor security behaviors, like using the same weak password across multiple sites and services. The adoption rate of password managers remains very low (Alkaldi & Renaud, 2016).

Any attempts to secure ourselves will necessarily center on designing for [human motivation](http://habitry.link/motivating-humans) and [decision-making](http://behavioralscientist.org/the-road-to-cybersecurity-is-paved-with-extraordinarily-basic-things/). Even information security researchers agree. They've started a field called... wait for it... Behavioral Information Security, in response to the observation that way too much of the focus has been on coming up with technical fixes instead of supporting behavior change (Crossler, Johnston, Lowry, Hu, Warkentin, & Baskerville, 2013).

#### [The default approach is failing]

Given the immense scale of the problem, it's doubtful that we'll ever be able to design ever more elaborate systems to secure ourselves. When facing a complex problem, we tend to look for complex solutions. Yet in an uncertain world, that's a mistake. "Overly complicated systems difficult to understand, easy to exploit, "difficult to understand, easy to exploit, and possible dangerous" (Gigerenzer, 2015).

What's needed is motivating people to use simple rules of thumb and behaviors that they can do easily. 

# [Problem + Unteach]

- Telling doesn't work. People know they should use secure passwords, 2fa, etc.

Workman, M. A test of interventions for security threats from social engineering. Information Management and Computer Security, 16, 5 (2008), 463–483.

- Scaring doesn't work. Explain PMT from health research.

PMT is a theory that says motivation to protect oneself comes from a perceived threat and a desire to avoid a potential negative outcome.

Fear only works if people feel competent and know what to do. (Kok et al; Fishbach et al on negative feedback)

- Nudging doesn't work.

- Self-Determination does.

- Give an obvious example of why the default approach is wrong.

- Restate why default approach is a big problem.

#### [Strategy]

- The SDT strategy in a nutshell.

Stop scaring and start relating. Relatedness increases relevance.

Fear based messages don't work because they thwart perceptions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

Provide choices within constraints.

First you have to understand why people practice bad behaviors. The status quo serves a purpose. It might not even be obvious to them, but their current behaviors fulfill a need. Figure out that need.

Second you have to understand why people don't want to use password managers. You have to make data breaches personally relevant, and promote internalization of security behaviors.

Third, fostering autonomy, competence, and relatednesss

## Tactics: How to apply SDT across different phases
- 1-3 guidelines about supporting *attention*. We're going to assuming you already have users and that you've got their attention. What can you do to support their intention to actually download your Password Manager?

Use Stephen Wendel's action funnel

It all starts with an intention to download the app. (Menard, Bott, Crossler study)

Use Marques et al MBCT study
  - MBCT 1, MBCT 2, etc

- 1-3 guidelines about supporting *onboarding*. What do you need to learn in order to tailor the experience for them? How can you support them in taking first steps?
-
  - MBCT 1, MBCT 2, etc
- 1-3 guidelines about supporting *maintenance*. Supporting motivation and habit formation.
  - MBCT 1, MBCT 2, etc

- Explain or *when* and *how* to apply the guidelines, with an explanation of *what* they can pay attention to figure out if its working

- Explain how you've used the guidelines in the past, and *why* they work.

## Conclusion

- Reminder of why the problem is important for the reader, with an example
- Reminder of their mistaken assumption
- Reminder of a solution
