# How to Increase Adoption of Password Managers: Stop Scaring and Start Motivating

# [Opener]

>On March 19 of this year, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta received an alarming email that appeared to come from Google.

>The email, however, didn't come from the internet giant. It was actually an attempt to hack into his personal account. In fact, the message came from a group of hackers that security researchers, as well as the US government, believe are spies working for the Russian government. At the time, however, Podesta didn't know any of this, and he clicked on the malicious link contained in the email, giving hackers access to his account.

There is a zeitgeist shift in the air. Massive phishing scams, data breaches, and identify theft are in the news. People are understandably worried. It's not just government employees who are vulnerable, but all of us. For example, [64% of Americans](http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/01/26/americans-and-cybersecurity/) have personally experienced a major data breach. Yet this is a global problem. In 2015, there were 2 billion Internet users, and cybercrime cost the world $3 *trillion*. By 2021, there will be 6 billion Internet users, and the cost of cybercrime is [expected to rise to $6 *trillion*](https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/) per year. Everything on Planet Earth — people, places, and things — are rapidly connected to the Internet. Much faster than our ability to secure them. For example, at this moment, there are 1.4 billion stolen passwords freely [available online](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3266607/password-security/1-4b-stolen-passwords-are-free-for-the-taking-what-we-know-now.html).

#### [Showing this is a behavioral problem]

If the Internet is like an "information superhighway", then most of us are driving around in a car without airbags or seat belts. People often engage in poor security behaviors. In America, 41% of online adults shared their passwords, 39% say they use the same passwords for many of their online accounts,  25% admit they use simpler passwords because they are easier to remember, and only 12% say they use password managers (Pew Research Center, 2017).

#### [The default approach is failing]

Any attempts to secure ourselves will necessarily center on designing for [human motivation](http://habitry.link/motivating-humans) and [decision-making](http://behavioralscientist.org/the-road-to-cybersecurity-is-paved-with-extraordinarily-basic-things/). Even information security researchers agree. They've started a field called Behavioral Information Security, in response to the observation that way too much of the focus has been on coming up with technical fixes instead of supporting behavior change (Crossler, Johnston, Lowry, Hu, Warkentin, & Baskerville, 2013).

# [Problem + Unteach]

Scaring people into change doesn't work. Most people [don't know](http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/03/22/what-the-public-knows-about-cybersecurity/) how to secure themselves online. This means scaring them into adopting more secure behaviors won't work. Let's take an example from health psychology. Many people assume that shocking smokers with graphic images will motivate them to stop smoking. This *only* works in those rare situations where people feel like their behavior is under their control and that they have the skills needed to change (Kok, Peters, Kessels, ten Hoor, Ruiter, 2018). Experts seek negative feedback. The rest of us novices need positive feedback that supports our sense of competence for us to feel motivated to change (Finkelstein & Fishbach, 2011).

A technology-only solution also won't work. Given the immense scale of the problem, why can't we just sidestep the human problem with a technology solution? It's doubtful that we'll ever be able to secure ourselves by just relying on technology. When facing a complex problem, we tend to look for complex solutions. Yet in an uncertain world, that's a mistake. "Overly complicated systems difficult to understand, easy to exploit, "difficult to understand, easy to exploit, and possible dangerous" (Gigerenzer, 2015).

We need to stop scaring people into using elaborate technical systems. What's needed is motivating people to use simple rules of thumb and behaviors that they can do easily and freely.

#### [Design Strategy: Stop Scaring and Start Relating]

We must support user perceptions that they *want* to change. We need to prevent feelings of pressure and coercion. And the first step toward toward motivating people toward that is to stop thinking of motivation as something you "add" to people, like a software update. Instead, you have to think of yourself as [a great host](http://habitry.link/motivating-humans). People are willing to consider your recommendations after they feel they can trust you. You have to relate to their experience. From the lens of their personal goals and values. To make data breaches personally relevant to them, you have to stop scaring and start relating (Menard, Bott, & Crossley, 2017).

High quality relationships support the satisfaction of three feelings:

Autonomy, the feeling you get when you act with a sense of choice, initiative, volition, and meaning. It’s the need to experience our actions as our own. The opposite of autonomy is feeling coerced and manipulated.

Competence, the feeling the feeling you get after attaining a difficult goal. You feel effective; that you can do things well. The opposite of competence is feeling ineffective and impotent.

Finally there's relatedness, the feeling you get when you feel understood and liked by people you care about. The opposite of relatedness is feeling misunderstood or disconnected.

Let's get into some tactics for how you can support autonomy, competence, and relatedness to support adoption of password managers throughout the entire behavior change process.

[image of phase 1 > phase 2> phase 3 as a cycle]

## Phase 1: Gain their trust.

We're going to assuming you already have users and that you've got their attention. What can you do to support their desire to actually download your Password Manager? Here's an example we stole directly from Mendard, Bott, & Crossley (2017):

Your passwords are the keys to your digital life, and your online accounts are a proverbial gold mine for someone looking to steal your identity. Hackers often accomplish identity theft by figuring out online passwords **[This is a relatedness satisfying statement because it connects to something the user cares about: protecting their digital life and identity]**. Regardless of how confident you are in your computer skills, you can learn how to create strong passwords and manage them using a password manager **[This is a competence satisfying statement because it tells the user they can succeed no matter their current skills]**. A password manager is software that aids in keeping track of multiple passwords. We recommend using Dashlane, 1Password, KeePass, or LastPass. Each of these is an adequate solution, so feel free to choose the software you like the best as your password manager **[This is an autonomy satisfying statement because it provides choices and tells the user how to pick].

- 1-3 guidelines about supporting *attention*.

Use Stephen Wendel's action funnel

It all starts with an intention to download the app. (Menard, Bott, Crossler study)

Use Marques et al MBCT study
  - MBCT 1, MBCT 2, etc

## Phase 2: Support onboarding.

- 1-3 guidelines about supporting *onboarding*. What do you need to learn in order to tailor the experience for them? How can you support them in taking first steps?
-
  - MBCT 1, MBCT 2, etc

## Phase 3: Support habit formation.

- 1-3 guidelines about supporting *maintenance*. Supporting motivation and habit formation.
  - MBCT 1, MBCT 2, etc

- Explain or *when* and *how* to apply the guidelines, with an explanation of *what* they can pay attention to figure out if its working

- Explain how you've used the guidelines in the past, and *why* they work.

## Conclusion

- Reminder of why the problem is important for the reader, with an example
- Reminder of their mistaken assumption
- Reminder of a solution
