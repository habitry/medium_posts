# How to Increase Adoption of Password Managers: Stop Scaring and Start Motivating

## Opener

But it's not just government employees. Everyone is vulnerable. At the center of security are people, with all their flaws.

- Stats showing how information security is important

The cost reached an all time high in 2015

Ponemon Institute. 2015 Cost of data breach study: United States. Ponemon Institute Research Report (2015), 1–22.

- Stats showing this is a behavioral problem

While having security countermeasures in place is a step in the right direction, home users often fail to adopt secure behaviors on a regular basis (i.e., sharing passwords, using weak passwords, clicking on unfamiliar links, and downloading e-mail attachments without proper scrutiny)

End users are the root cause of 25% of data breaches

The adoption rate of password managers remains low (Alkaldi & Renaud, 2016)

InfoSec behaviors are just like motivating health behaviors. A recent article on Behavioral Scientist made this point. In fact, health researchers have been examining the impact of fear messages for years. We can learn from them.

Motivation arouses, directs, and sustains voluntary behaviors. It's been heavily studied in psychology and has been shown to have significant effects on feelings, thoughts, and behaviors (Vallerand et al)

Behavioral Information Security was started in response to the observation that even though a major weakness in securing information are people, much of the focus has been on coming up with technical fixes (Crossler, Johnston, Lowry, Hu, Warkentin, & Baskerville, 2013)

- The default approach is failing

The size of the problem increased by 55%

Villatte, N. 2015 Data Breach Investigations Report. Basking Ridge, NJ: Verizon Enterprise Solutions, 2015.

## Problem + Unteach

- Telling doesn't work. People know they should use secure passwords, 2fa, etc.

Workman, M. A test of interventions for security threats from social engineering. Information Management and Computer Security, 16, 5 (2008), 463–483.

- Scaring doesn't work. Explain PMT from health research.

PMT is a theory that says motivation to protect oneself comes from a perceived threat and a desire to avoid a potential negative outcome.

Fear only works if people feel competent and know what to do. (Kok et al; Fishbach et al on negative feedback)

- Nudging doesn't work.

- Self-Determination does.

- Give an obvious example of why the default approach is wrong.

- Restate why default approach is a big problem.

## Strategy

- The SDT strategy in a nutshell.

Stop scaring and start relating. Relatedness increases relevance.

Fear based messages don't work because they thwart perceptions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

Provide choices within constraints.

First you have to understand why people practice bad behaviors. The status quo serves a purpose. It might not even be obvious to them, but their current behaviors fulfill a need. Figure out that need.

Second you have to understand why people don't want to use password managers. You have to make data breaches personally relevant, and promote internalization of security behaviors.

Third, fostering autonomy, competence, and relatednesss

## Tactics: How to apply SDT across different phases
- 1-3 guidelines about supporting *attention*. We're going to assuming you already have users and that you've got their attention. What can you do to support their intention to actually download your Password Manager?

It all starts with an intention to download the app. (Menard, Bott, Crossler study)

Use Marques et al MBCT study
  - MBCT 1, MBCT 2, etc

- 1-3 guidelines about supporting *onboarding*. What do you need to learn in order to tailor the experience for them? How can you support them in taking first steps?
-
  - MBCT 1, MBCT 2, etc
- 1-3 guidelines about supporting *maintenance*. Supporting motivation and habit formation.
  - MBCT 1, MBCT 2, etc

- Explain or *when* and *how* to apply the guidelines, with an explanation of *what* they can pay attention to figure out if its working

- Explain how you've used the guidelines in the past, and *why* they work.

## Conclusion

- Reminder of why the problem is important for the reader, with an example
- Reminder of their mistaken assumption
- Reminder of a solution
