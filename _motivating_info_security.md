# How to Increase Adoption of Password Managers: Stop Scaring and Start Motivating

## Opener

- John Podesta got phished.

But it's not just government employees. Everyone is vulnerable. At the center of security are people, with all their flaws.

- Stats showing how information security is important

The cost reached an all time high in 2015

Ponemon Institute. 2015 Cost of data breach study: United States. Ponemon Institute Research Report (2015), 1–22.

And the size of the problem increased by 55%

- Stats showing this is a behavioral problem

While having security countermeasures in place is a step in the right direction, home users often fail to adopt secure behaviors on a regular basis (i.e., sharing passwords, using weak passwords, clicking on unfamiliar links, and downloading e-mail attachments without proper scrutiny) [3, 19, 46].

End users are the root cause of 25% of data breaches

InfoSec behaviors are just like motivating health behaviors. A recent article on Behavioral Scientist made this point. In fact, health researchers have been examining the impact of fear messages for years. We can learn from them.

Motivation arouses, directs, and sustains voluntary behaviors. It's been heavily studied in psychology and has been shown to have significant effects on feelings, thoughts, and behaviors (Vallerand et al)

Behavioral Information Security was started in response to the observation that even though a major weakness in securing information are people, much of the focus has been on coming up with technical fixes (Crossler, Johnston, Lowry, Hu, Warkentin, & Baskerville, 2013)

- The default approach is failing

[47, 72, 73, 78].

## Problem + Unteach

- Telling doesn't work. People know they should use secure passwords, 2fa, etc.


76. Workman, M. A test of interventions for security threats from social engineering. Information Management and Computer Security, 16, 5 (2008), 463–483.

- Scaring doesn't work. Explain PMT from health research.

PMT is a theory that says motivation to protect oneself comes from a perceived threat and a desire to avoid a potential negative outcome.

- Nudging doesn't work.

- Self-Determination does.

- Give an obvious example of why the default approach is wrong.

- Restate why default approach is a big problem.

## Strategy

- The SDT strategy in a nutshell.

You have to make data breaches personally relevant, and promote internalization of security behaviors.

## Tactics: How to apply SDT across different phases
- 1-3 guidelines about supporting *attention*.
  - MBCT 1, MBCT 2, etc
- 1-3 guidelines about supporting *onboarding*.
  - MBCT 1, MBCT 2, etc
- 1-3 guidelines about supporting *maintenance*.
  - MBCT 1, MBCT 2, etc

- Explain or *when* and *how* to apply the guidelines, with an explanation of *what* they can pay attention to figure out if its working

- Explain how you've used the guidelines in the past, and *why* they work.

## Conclusion

- Reminder of why the problem is important for the reader, with an example
- Reminder of their mistaken assumption
- Reminder of a solution
