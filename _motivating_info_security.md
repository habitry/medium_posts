# How to Increase Adoption and Use of Password Managers: Stop Scaring and Start Motivating

## [Opener]

>On March 19 of this year, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta received an alarming email that appeared to come from Google.

>The email, however, didn't come from the internet giant. It was actually an attempt to hack into his personal account. In fact, the message came from a group of hackers that security researchers, as well as the US government, believe are spies working for the Russian government. At the time, however, Podesta didn't know any of this, and he clicked on the malicious link contained in the email, giving hackers access to his account.

There's a zeitgeist shift in the air. Massive phishing scams, data breaches, and identify theft are in the news. People are understandably worried. It's not just government employees who are vulnerable, but all of us. For example, 64% of Americans have personally experienced a major data breach (Olmstead & Smith, 2017a). Yet this is a global problem. In 2015, there were 2 billion Internet users, and cybercrime cost the world $3 *trillion*. By 2021, there will be 6 billion Internet users, and the cost of cybercrime is expected to rise to $6 *trillion* per year (Cybersecurity Ventures, 2017). Everything on Planet Earth — people, places, and things — is rapidly connected to the Internet. Much faster than our ability to secure them. For example, at this moment, there are 1.4 billion stolen passwords freely [available online](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3266607/password-security/1-4b-stolen-passwords-are-free-for-the-taking-what-we-know-now.html).

#### [Showing this is a behavioral problem]

If the Internet is like an "information superhighway", then most of us are driving around in a car without airbags or seat belts. People often engage in poor security behaviors. In America, 41% of online adults shared their passwords, 39% say they use the same passwords for many of their online accounts,  25% admit they use simpler passwords because they are easier to remember, and **only 12%** say they use a password manager (Olmstead & Smith, 2017b).

#### [The default approach is failing]

Any attempts to secure ourselves will necessarily center on designing for [human motivation](http://habitry.link/motivating-humans) and [decision-making](http://behavioralscientist.org/the-road-to-cybersecurity-is-paved-with-extraordinarily-basic-things/). Even information security researchers agree. They've started a field called Behavioral Information Security, in response to the observation that way too much of the focus has been on coming up with technical fixes instead of supporting behavior change (Crossler, Johnston, Lowry, Hu, Warkentin, & Baskerville, 2013).

## [Problem + Unteach]

Scaring people into change doesn't work. Most people don't know basic information on how to secure themselves online (Olmstead & Smith, 2017a). This means scaring them into adopting more secure behaviors won't work. Let's take an example from health psychology. Many people assume that shocking smokers with horrible images of disease on cigarette packaging will motivate smokers to stop buy cigarettes. Yet scaring people into change *only* works in those rare situations where people feel like their behavior is under their control and that they have the skills needed to change (Kok, Peters, Kessels, ten Hoor, Ruiter, 2018). Experts seek negative feedback. The rest of us novices need meaningful positive feedback that supports our sense of competence for us to feel motivated to change (Finkelstein & Fishbach, 2011).

A technology-only solution also won't work. Given the immense scale of the problem, you might think it would be best to just sidestep the human problem with a technical fix. It's doubtful that we'll ever be able to secure ourselves by just relying on technology. When facing a complex problem, we tend to look for complex solutions. Yet in an uncertain world, that's a mistake. "Overly complicated systems difficult to understand, easy to exploit, and possible dangerous" (Gigerenzer, 2015).

We need to stop scaring people into using risky and elaborate technical systems. What's needed is motivating people to use simple rules of thumb and behaviors that they can do easily and freely.

## Designing a Motivational Behavior Change Journey

To design for behavior change, you have to:

1. Identify target behaviors your people want to do.
2. Identify barriers in the way of your people doing those behaviors.
3. Identify behavior change techniques that help them get past those barriers.

As our friend [Dustin DiTommaso](https://twitter.com/DU5TB1N) likes to say, "there is almost never a situation when motivation is never a driver of behavior change". So let's talk about that.

The first step toward toward motivating people toward is to stop thinking of motivation as something you "add" to people, like a software update. Instead, you have to think of yourself as [a great host](http://habitry.link/motivating-humans). People are willing to consider your recommendations after they feel they can trust you. You have to relate to their experience from the lens of their personal goals and values. To make data breaches personally relevant to them, you have to stop scaring and [start relating](http://habitry.link/community).

Relating well with people requires the satisfaction of three feelings (Deci & Ryan, 2014):

**Competence**, the feeling the feeling you get after attaining a difficult goal. You feel effective; that you can do things well. The opposite of competence is feeling ineffective and impotent.

**Autonomy**, the feeling you get when you act with a sense of choice, initiative, volition, and meaning. It’s the need to experience our actions as our own. The opposite of autonomy is feeling coerced and manipulated.

Finally there's **relatedness**, the feeling you get when you feel understood and liked by people you care about. The opposite of relatedness is feeling misunderstood or disconnected.

Let's get into some tactics for how you can support autonomy, competence, and relatedness to support adoption of password managers throughout the entire behavior change journey.

**The Meta Rule: Don't make them feel stupid, manipulated, or misunderstood. Satisfy competence, autonomy, and relatedness.**

[image of phase 1 > phase 2> phase 3 as a cycle]

## Phase 1: Build Trust

**Their situation:** A person starts searching for a password manager.

**Their desired outcome:** They want to fix their password problem.

**Your desired outcome:** You want them to use your password manager.

**Your challenge:** They don't trust you.

What would get someone to start searching for a password manager? Given that only 12% of Americans use a password manager, you might think people *decide* to not use a password manager. But it's more accurate to say that for most people, the thought of downloading a password manager doesn't ever cross their mind. About 60% of our behavior is habitual; we have daily routines that we rarely stray from. And when we do decide to act, often it's based on a gut feeling that something is urgent to do, rather than a cost-benefit calculation.

Imagine what kind of situation would motivate a person to start searching for a password manager. They probably find themselves in a situation where one of their online accounts was compromised, and the service sent them an email about it. That's what motivated to Omar to start his search. Or perhaps a person starts searching because their InfoSec expert friends told them to. That also motivated Omar.

Now imagine they've landed on a website for one of the popular password managers. This is a critical point in their journey to find a solution. It's a moment tinged with anxiety - I need to fix my password problem. There are also traces of hope - I really hope this thing can fix my password problem. In the next few milliseconds, with little conscious reflection, they'll feel trust or the lack of it. A gut feeling based on some simple cues rather than a cost-benefit analysis. Your job is to facilitate their trust by displaying cues that communicate you understand their situation.

### Tactic: Communicate you like them.

Build rapport by relating to their situation. We trust people that understand us. One way you can convey this is through images and text that show there are other people just like them using your solution. Convey you understand their experiences, problems, values, desires, geographic location, and interests. Really, communicating about any attribute they have will foster perceptions of connection and relatedness. You'll know you've been successful at building trust if your users can say, "They like me and like to help people just like me.

**Motivation & Behavior Change Techniques:** Take interest in the person, and provide credible sources and role models.

### Tactic: Request with a meaningful rationale.

Now that you've built rapport, the next challenge is to make your request without accidentally making them feel stupid, manipulated, or misunderstood. How can you do that? Here's an example we stole directly from Menard, Bott, & Crossley (2017):

>Your passwords are the keys to your digital life, and your online accounts are a proverbial gold mine for someone looking to steal your identity. Hackers often accomplish identity theft by figuring out online passwords.

That is a relatedness satisfying statement because it connects to something the user cares about: protecting their digital life and identity

>Regardless of how confident you are in your computer skills, you can learn how to create strong passwords and manage them using a password manager.

That is a competence satisfying statement because it tells the user they can succeed no matter their current skills.

>A password manager is software that aids in keeping track of multiple passwords. We recommend using Dashlane, 1Password, KeePass, or LastPass. Each of these is an adequate solution, so feel free to choose the software you like the best as your password manager.

 That is an autonomy satisfying statement because it provides choices and tells the user how to pick.

**Motivation & Behavior Change Techniques:** Take interest in the person, provide optimal challenge, and provide choice.

## Phase 2: Onboarding

**Their situation:** A person has downloaded your password manager.  

**Their desired outcome:** They want to know if they can fix their password issues with little to no effort as possible.

**Your desired outcome:** You need them to start using the password manager.

**Your challenge:** Making their first steps as effortless as possible.

Now you've gained their trust and they actually downloaded your app. Great! Now is the time to support their transition from outsiders to insiders in your [community](http://habitry.link/community). You want to help them feel like they can use your password manager successfully , that they're in the right place, and that they made the right choice.

### Tactic: Use scaffolding to foster competence.

Onboarding is the point in time when people will have the highest motivation they'll ever have to learn anything. It's like New Years Day. Use it wisely. Still, even though they're motivation is high, their skills and knowledge are quite low. How would you design a journey if you thought of them as baby power users? If you demand too much of them, you can accidentally make them feel stupid. You need to support the hell out of their competence. Way more than you think they need. That's because you suffer from [The Curse of Knowledge](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Curse_of_knowledge) and you've forgotten how hard it was for you to learn all this password management stuff the first time you came across it.

You could start by showing them a brief video of someone like them using your app. Merely watching others perform can foster our perception of competence (Kardas & O'Brien, 2018). This is great because it's everyone is capable of watch a short video. It makes them feel like they are learning. And you've taken away any possibility of them making a mistake. Success!

The next step up in the scaffold would be to provide a mock walkthrough with tool tips. Walk them through how to use the app on a made up account, so there's no way they can make a real mistake. You also want to start giving them precise hints on how to take specific actions in your app, along with meaningful positive feedback when they do take those actions.

Finally, you can walk them through with their real accounts. For example, LastPass have a Security Challenge, where they audit a user's passwords and then provide simple suggestions on how a user can increase their "security score". Alternatively, you can

**Motivation & Behavior Change Techniques**: Provide optimal challenge, demonstration of the behavior, instruction on how to perform the behavior, goal-setting, and feedback on behavior.

### Phase 3: Support long-term commitment

**Their situation:** A person has downloaded your password manager and completed your onboarding process.

**Their desired outcome:** They want to know if they can keep using your password manager.

**Your desired outcome:** You need them to support new habits and break old ones. And maybe you want to create some raving fans.

**Your challenge:** Promote unlearning and prevent boredom.

### Tactic: Co-opt old habit cues to teach them a new habits.

A habit is a repeated behavior that is triggered by cues in our environment. It's automatic, meaning it happens without our conscious control.  This is awesome, because it means we can outsource decisions about starting a behavior to our environments. This is not awesome if a habit stops being useful for our goals.

For example, password managers go against the grain of how people expect passwords to work. That's uncomfortable for people.
Understanding what a password manager does requires a subtle shift on a person's mental model of how to use a password. After tens of thousands of repetitions, we've all trained ourselves to memorize passwords, and to be the ones in control of them. Using a password manager requires you to unlearn what it means to keep yourself secure. You have to stop thinking of a password manager as a spreadsheet with your passwords, and more like your personal security concierge. You have to trust technology. You have to trust that you won't lose access to your accounts despite not knowing what the passwords are to your accounts.

The first step to breaking a habit is to change your environment so that you don't come across cues that trigger it. The second step is to do the new habit you want in the presence of that cue. The third step is to make the new habit as easy as possible.

Most modern password managers do this wonderfully well by co-opting existing cues in service of new habits. For example, they'll ask you if you want to add a password to your vault after you enter it in the course of your regular web browsing. Next, they'll start suggesting the new habit: use the password manager to enter your password on this site from now on. Finally, they make it as easy as possible by offering one click logins to all online accounts.

### Tactic: Encourage them to bring other people into your community

By now you've built their trust, supported their onboarding, and helped them build new more secure habits. Your users are feeling successful, and some of them might want to spread the love. This could be as simple as showing them how they can help their friends and family live more secure lives, too. And it could be as involved as creating a [community of behavior change](http://habitry.link/community) with them.

## Conclusion

The Internet is ubiquitous, it seems so are poor security practices. If we want to secure our future, it makes sense to design for motivation and behavior change. That doesn't mean scaring people into changing. Rather, it means relating to people so that they feel motivated to use simple rules of thumb consistently. Use our design tactics to make that happen.
