# How to Use a Motivation Audit to Design for Behavior Change

# Opener

- Behavior change design is about creating situations that support Basic Psychological Needs, so people think, feel, or act differently from how they would normally.
- Designers/Managers create Systems that interact with Users that fulfill or thwart BPN.
- But... what BCTs to use when? 

## Problem + Unteach

- Most designers jump straight to techniques. Start with a Behavior Change Audit.
- Give an obvious example of why skipping straight to techniques is the wrong approach.
- Restate why the default approach is a big problem.

## A solution

- Problem-setting to pick MBCTs
- Meta-strategies in order of difficulty for users: design products with better defaults, promote habits, break habits, educate.

- Start with articulating Point B. Outcomes > behavior > barriers > behavior change techniques.
- Articulate Point A.
- Create autonomy/competence/relatedness journeys to support users from Point A to Point B.

- 3-5 questions to start thinking about a solution.
- 1-3 guidelines for *when* and *how* to apply questions, with an explanation of *what* they'll learn.
- Explain how you've used the guidelines in the past, and *why* they work.

## Conclusion

- Reminder of why the problem is important for the reader, with an example
- Reminder of their mistaken assumption
- Reminder of a solution
