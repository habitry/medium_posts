# WORKING TITLE (How to Motivate With Leaderboards: Stop Creating Losers)

# Opener

- Leaderboards are a common behavior change design pattern.  
- Product designers imagine leaderboards will motivate because everyone wants to be a winner. (Articulate their logic model)
- But leaderboards are demotivating for everyone else.

# A Motivation Problem

- Competition creates more losers than winners. Support Self-Determination instead.
- Give an obvious example of why excessive focus on winning is a bad idea (maybe the wellsfargo sales corruption?).
- Restate why the default competition focused approach is a big problem.

# Designing a Motivational Leaderboard

- Strategy: Leaderboards only work in BPN-supportive climates. Support BPN and limit thwarting.
- Tactics: Breakdown leaderboards by doing a BCT analysis. Then show how to support BPN using each technique.

# A Behavior Change Technique Analysis of Leaderboards

A leaderboard is a system of behavior change techniques...

### Goal-setting
- individual vs group goal
- extrinsic vs intrinsic goals
- playing vs performing goals (make it about having fun learning vs winning)

### Feedback & monitoring

- Outcomes vs process vs self tracking;
- feedback (give feedback to the losers; giving autonomy support reduces pain of losses)
- how to limit ego-involvement; mastery goals protect against social comparison; winning by small amount was most enjoyable;)

### Social support & comparison

- social norms (autonomous vs controlled motives for why we're behaving)
- social comparisons are more potent when they are local, involve unknown dimensions, and manipulate the self; assimilation requires special priming

### Rewards

- Make them surprising
- Tie them to bigger picture life goals and aspirations
- Don't use tangible rewards
- Use intrinsic/meaningful rewards that support competence

## Conclusion

- Reminder of why the problem is important for the reader, with an example
- Reminder of their mistaken assumption
- Reminder of a solution
