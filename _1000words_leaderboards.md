# WORKING TITLE (How to Motivate With Leaderboards: Stop Creating Losers)

# Opener

Leaderboards are a common behavior change design pattern. Originally included in video games, leaderboards have started to infiltrate "video game like" products such as...

* Nike+, a fitness tracker device, which motivates users to exercise more by competing against their friends for activity points.
* Opower, a energy tracking platform, which motivates users to reduce their energy use by showing how much energy they use compared to their neighbors.
* Github, a project management tool for programmers, which motivates users to contribute to projects more by publicly displaying the number of contributions to projects by made by individual community members.

Product managers and designers use leaderboards to motivate people to use their products more. The idea is that leaderboards are motivating because people like to participate in and win contests against peers in a [community](http://habitry.link/community).

# Problem + Unteach

But the motivational effects of competition aren't that simple. Murayama and Elliot's (2012) set of meta-analyses found competition had positive *and* negative effects on participant performance. For instance, competition helped or harmed performance depending what "competing" meant to participants. Competition's effects were a function of participant performance goals. Did participants want to win or avoid losing? Murayama and Elliot found that participants who wanted to avoid performing worse than others performed worse in competition. And participants who wanted to perform better than others fared better in competition. Competition motivates winners and demotivates everyone else.

By default, people choose to compare upwards.

When comparing upwards, they self-evaluate down. When comparing downwards, they self-evaluate up. This effect is stronger when comparing themselves on ability or affect.

Dissimilarity priming was associated with contrast. Similarity priming had weak assimilation effects.

Assimilation doesn't appear to be the default; it requires special priming.

Thinking they can win requires special priming.


Competition induces social comparison.

This is dangerous because trying to avoid losing reduces goal achievement (Burnette et al 2013) and performance (Murayama & Elliot 2012).

Progress monitoring increase goal achievement, especially when outcomes are reported or made public, and when info is physically recorded (Harkin et al 2016)

- Restate why the default competition focused approach is a big problem.
- Give an obvious example of why excessive focus on winning is a bad idea (maybe the wellsfargo sales corruption?).

# Designing a Motivational Leaderboard

- Strategy: Leaderboards only work in BPN-supportive climates. Support BPN and limit thwarting.
- Tactics: Breakdown leaderboards by doing a BCT analysis. Then show how to support BPN using each technique.
- Connection rather than competition.
- Mastery rather than performance.

# A Behavior Change Technique Analysis of Leaderboards

A leaderboard is a system of behavior change techniques...

### Goals and planning
- individual vs group goal
- extrinsic vs intrinsic goals
- playing vs performing goals (make it about having fun learning vs winning)

### Feedback & monitoring

- Outcomes vs process vs self tracking;
- feedback (give feedback to the losers; giving autonomy support reduces pain of losses)
- how to limit ego-involvement; mastery goals protect against social comparison; winning by small amount was most enjoyable;)

### Social comparison

- social norms (autonomous vs controlled motives for why we're behaving)
- social comparisons are more potent when they are local, involve unknown dimensions, and manipulate the self; assimilation requires special priming

##### Rewards

- Make them surprising
- Tie them to bigger picture life goals and aspirations
- Don't use tangible rewards
- Use intrinsic/meaningful rewards that support competence

## Conclusion

- Reminder of why the problem is important for the reader, with an example
- Reminder of their mistaken assumption
- Reminder of a solution
