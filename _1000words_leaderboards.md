# WORKING TITLE (How to Motivate With Leaderboards: Stop Creating Losers)

# Opener

Leaderboards are a common behavior change design pattern. Originally included in video games, leaderboards have started to infiltrate "video game like" products such as...

* Nike+, a fitness tracker device, which motivates users to exercise more by competing against their friends for activity points.
* Opower, a energy tracking platform, which motivates users to reduce their energy use by showing how much energy they use compared to their neighbors.
* Github, a project management tool for programmers, which motivates users to contribute to projects more by publicly displaying the number of contributions to projects by made by individual community members.

Product managers and designers use leaderboards to motivate people to use their products more. People don't like to use our app? We'll make it fun by adding a leaderboard to our app! The idea is that leaderboards are motivating because people like to participate in and win contests against peers in a [community](http://habitry.link/community).

# Competition Doesn't Work

But the motivational effects of competition aren't simple. For example, Murayama and Elliot's (2012) set of meta-analyses concluded there is no overall benefit of competition. That's because there are positive and negative effects of competition on performance, which tend to cancel each other out. It turns out, whether competition helped or harmed performance depended on the meaning participants ascribed to the act of competing. When participants wanted to avoid performing worse than others (perhaps because they weren't confident in their ability), competition decreased their performance. When participants wanted to perform better than others, competition improved performance. This suggests we can't expect leaderboards to be uniformly positive for everyone, because competition isn't uniformly positive for everyone.

- Restate why the default competition focused approach is a big problem.
- Give an obvious example of why excessive focus on winning is a bad idea (maybe the wellsfargo sales corruption?).

# Designing a Motivational Leaderboard

- Strategy: Leaderboards only work in BPN-supportive climates. Support BPN and limit thwarting.
- Tactics: Breakdown leaderboards by doing a BCT analysis. Then show how to support BPN using each technique.
- Connection rather than competition.
- Mastery rather than performance.


# A Behavior Change Technique Analysis of Leaderboards

A leaderboard is a system of behavior change techniques...

### Goal-setting
- individual vs group goal
- extrinsic vs intrinsic goals
- playing vs performing goals (make it about having fun learning vs winning)

### Feedback

- Outcomes vs process vs self tracking;
- feedback (give feedback to the losers; giving autonomy support reduces pain of losses)
- how to limit ego-involvement; mastery goals protect against social comparison; winning by small amount was most enjoyable;)

### Social comparison

- social norms (autonomous vs controlled motives for why we're behaving)
- social comparisons are more potent when they are local, involve unknown dimensions, and manipulate the self; assimilation requires special priming

### Rewards

- Make them surprising
- Tie them to bigger picture life goals and aspirations
- Don't use tangible rewards
- Use intrinsic/meaningful rewards that support competence

## Conclusion

- Reminder of why the problem is important for the reader, with an example
- Reminder of their mistaken assumption
- Reminder of a solution
