# How to Motivate With Leaderboards: Stop Making Losers

Leaderboards are a common behavior change design pattern. Originally included in video games, leaderboards have started to infiltrate "video game like" products such as...

* Nike+, a fitness tracker device, which motivates users to exercise more by competing against their friends for activity points.
* Opower, a energy tracking platform, which motivates users to reduce their energy use by showing how much energy they use compared to their neighbors.
* Github, a project management tool for programmers, which motivates users to contribute to projects more by publicly displaying the number of contributions to projects by made by individual community members.

Product managers and designers use leaderboards to motivate people to use their products more. The idea is that leaderboards are motivating because people like to win and winning is motivating because it gives us status in our [communities](http://habitry.link/community).

## Leaderboards: A Motivation Problem

>Winning doesn't mean anything unless someone else loses — The Man in Black, Westworld

But some people don't want to win. Some want to avoid losing. This is a subtle yet crucial distinction. Murayama and Elliot's (2012) set of meta-analyses found the effects of competition depend on whether players desire to win or avoid losing. It depends on your goals. When you want to perform better than others, you tend to benefit from competition (duh?). But when you want to avoid performing worse than others, your performance tends to go down in competition. Similarly, Burnette et al's (2013) meta-analysis found that the desire to win is positively related to goal achievement, whereas the desire to avoid losing is negatively related to goal achievement. Finally, Senko et al's (2017) meta-analysis found that the desire to win improves achievement only when it's accompanied by strategies that support feelings of mastery rather than help avoidance or self-handicapping. Using design patterns that foster competition (aka something like a leaderboard) doesn't improve motivation and performance for all users in all situations. What all this research suggests is that competition is good for motivation and achievement only when it helps users feel competent. Leaderboards are a motivation problem, and you can design for that.

# Designing a Motivational Leaderboard




- Strategy: Leaderboards only work in BPN-supportive climates. Support BPN and limit thwarting.
- Tactics: Breakdown leaderboards by doing a BCT analysis. Then show how to support BPN using each technique.
- Connection rather than competition.
- Mastery rather than performance.

# A Behavior Change Technique Analysis of Leaderboards

A leaderboard is a system of behavior change techniques...

### Goals and planning
- individual vs group goal
- extrinsic vs intrinsic goals
- playing vs performing goals (make it about having fun learning vs winning)

### Feedback & monitoring

- Outcomes vs process vs self tracking;
- feedback (give feedback to the losers; giving autonomy support reduces pain of losses)
- how to limit ego-involvement; mastery goals protect against social comparison; winning by small amount was most enjoyable;)

### Social comparison

- social norms (autonomous vs controlled motives for why we're behaving)
- social comparisons are more potent when they are local, involve unknown dimensions, and manipulate the self; assimilation requires special priming

##### Rewards

- Make them surprising
- Tie them to bigger picture life goals and aspirations
- Don't use tangible rewards
- Use intrinsic/meaningful rewards that support competence

## Conclusion

- Reminder of why the problem is important for the reader, with an example
- Reminder of their mistaken assumption
- Reminder of a solution
