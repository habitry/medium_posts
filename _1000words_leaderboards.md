# How to Motivate With Leaderboards: Stop Making Losers

Leaderboards are a common behavior change design pattern. Originally included in video games, leaderboards have started to infiltrate "video game like" products such as...

* Nike+, a fitness tracker device, which motivates users to exercise more by competing against their friends for activity points.
* Opower, a energy tracking platform, which motivates users to reduce their energy use by showing how much energy they use compared to their neighbors.
* Github, a project management tool for programmers, which motivates users to contribute to projects more by publicly displaying the number of contributions to projects by made by individual community members.

Product managers and designers use leaderboards to motivate people to use their products more. The idea is that leaderboards are motivating because people like to win and winning is motivating because it gives us status in our [communities](http://habitry.link/community).

## Leaderboards: A Motivation Problem

>Winning doesn't mean anything unless someone else loses — The Man in Black, Westworld

But some people don't want to win. They want to avoid losing. This is a subtle yet crucial distinction. Murayama and Elliot's (2012) set of meta-analyses found the effects of competition depend on whether players desire to win or avoid losing. It depends on your goals. When you want to perform better than others, you tend to benefit from competition (duh?). But when you want to avoid performing worse than others, your performance tends to go down in competition. Similarly, Burnette et al's (2013) meta-analysis found that the desire to win is positively related to goal achievement, whereas the desire to avoid losing is negatively related to goal achievement. Finally, Senko et al's (2017) meta-analysis found that the desire to win improves achievement only when it's accompanied by strategies that support feelings of mastery rather than help-avoidance or self-handicapping.

Using design patterns that foster competition, (like leaderboards) doesn't improve motivation and performance for all users in all situations. Competition is good for motivation and achievement only when they it helps users feel competent. Leaderboards are a motivation problem, and you can design for that.

# Designing a Motivational Leaderboard

![How Leaderboards Motivate or Demotivate](images/leaderboards/diagram1.png)

[Self-Determination Theory](http://habitry.link/motivating-humans) argues that human beings seek and engage with activities that promise and satisfy three fundamental intrinsic motivations that all human beings across all cultures require for optimal health, well-being, and performance. All user interactions with an interface can support or frustrate the satisfaction of these Basic Psychological Needs (Peters, Calvo, & Ryan, 2018). If you want to design a motivational leaderboard, you must design with these three needs in mind.

**Competence** is the satisfaction you get when you complete a challenging goal. You feel masterful and effective; that you can do things well. The opposite of competence is feeling ineffective and helpless.

**Relatedness** is the satisfaction you get when you feel understood and liked by people you care about. The opposite of relatedness is feeling rejected and disconnected.

**Autonomy** is the satisfaction you get when you act with a sense of initiative, volition, and choice. The opposite of autonomy is feeling coerced and manipulated.

Well designed leaderboards promote the satisfaction of competence, relatedness, and autonomy for most users, most of the time, and they don't pit these needs against each other. For example, a risk with leaderboards is that they pit competence against relatedness. By trying to get us to win in a competition against people we play with, they can satisfy competence at the price of frustrating relatedness.

### The Mantra: Competence and Connection over Competition

Next, we breakdown leaderboards into their behavior change elements and share tactics and show you how you can design these elements so that they satisfy competence, relatedness, and autonomy.

# Design Tactics

A behavior change technique is an "active ingredient that brings about behavior change" (Michie et al. 2013). Most leaderboards are typically system of four behavior change techniques:

1. Goal-setting
2. Feedback
3. Social comparison
4. Social reward



### Goals and planning
- individual vs group goal
- extrinsic vs intrinsic goals
- playing vs performing goals (make it about having fun learning vs winning)

### Feedback & monitoring

- Outcomes vs process vs self tracking;
- feedback (give feedback to the losers; giving autonomy support reduces pain of losses)
- how to limit ego-involvement; mastery goals protect against social comparison; winning by small amount was most enjoyable;)
- self-monoitring meta-analysis

### Social comparison

- social norms (autonomous vs controlled motives for why we're behaving)
- social comparisons are more potent when they are local, involve unknown dimensions, and manipulate the self; assimilation requires special priming
- social comparison meta-analysis

##### Rewards

- Make them surprising
- Tie them to bigger picture life goals and aspirations
- Don't use tangible rewards
- Use intrinsic/meaningful rewards that support competence

## Conclusion

- Reminder of why the problem is important for the reader, with an example
- Reminder of their mistaken assumption
- Reminder of a solution
