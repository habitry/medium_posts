# Opener


- Example of a shitty customer service conversation that everyone can relate to.
- Stats on the business and social costs of bad conversations.
- The default approach is failing.

## Problem + Unteach

- Stop being an Accidental Asshole. Support BPN.
- State an assumption the reader is making that is getting them to overlook the problem
- State why their assumption is a delusion
- State why the problem is important for them

## A solution

The process:

1. Elicit what their desired outcome (Point B: Who will do what differently, when, where, and for how long?)
2. Elicit the barriers (Point A: What's the status quo?).
3. Create autonomy/competence/relatedness journeys to support users from Point A to Point B.
